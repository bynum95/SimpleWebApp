This is a vanilla Javascript Hangman game. To start, input your name. Then, you will be given the empty phrase, amount guesses you receive, and a clue. Input the character. If correct, you can continue guessing. If not, your remaining guesses will decrease and the program will start to build out the hangman. At the end of the game, you're given the option to play again. If you've continuously played and used up all of the phrases, then the game will prompt that it is over.
